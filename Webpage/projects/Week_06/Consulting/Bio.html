			  <h3>About Annetter Nystrom</h3>
				<p>I have assisted attorneys in the areas of Elder Care and Elder Law, including Guardianship Proceedings, Surrogate's Court Proceedings, preparing and supervising Special Needs Trusts, Wills, Trusts and Estates, preparation and witnessing execution of advanced directives, Trust Administration, Surrogate's Court Litigation, Missing Heir Searches, negotiating and settling Medicaid claims, assisting with Fair Hearings, preparation of Estate tax returns, and Real Estate.<br />
</p>
				<p>My first law firm experience, as a young adult, began at Milbank Tweed Hadley and McCloy. While attending college to become a schoolteacher, I worked at the prestigious Manhattan law firm for about three years where I participated in discussions about a new concept in the form of assistance for busy attorneys known as the &quot;paralegal&quot;.<br />
			  </p>
				<p>Although I began my career as a second grade school teacher at St. Theresa's in Woodside, New York, I later continued with my education at Queens College where I received my paralegal certificate. I graduated with top honors and won an internship in the area of research. I  received an honorable mention in a text book for paralegals for my research paper.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Since obtaining my paralegal certificate, I have continually assisted attorneys in the areas previously mentioned. I have participated in continuing education courses in the areas of Guardianships and Estate matters, through several Bar Association sponsored programs.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>In 2008, I formed Accounting and Fiduciary Services as a way to more fully utilize my rich experiences as a paralegal. Working in small law firms over the years, I saw the need attorneys had for immediate professional assistance with short term or specific projects.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>The staff of Accounting and Fiduciary Services currently assists attorneys with last minute  and difficult projects, and has been received with enthusiasm and praise for our professional service. <br />
			    </p>
				<p>Now, as an independent paralegal, I and my staff can reach out to a wide range of attorneys in need of experienced paralegal services without the long term financial commitment to a salaried employee.<br />
