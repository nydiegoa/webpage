			  <h3>What we do</h3>
				<p>What does a contract paralegal do?<br />
			  </p>
				<p>Time is of the essence<br />
			  </p>
				<p>Having worked in law firms for over eighteen years, I've  experienced the time crunches that all busy attorneys live with on a daily  basis: appointments with clients, the never ending return phone calls, document  preparations, court appearances, court document return dates, accountings,  reminders to clients and general meetings to keep your skills updated - just to  name a few of your responsibilities!<br />
				  </p>
				<p>Add to your already  busy schedule all that's involved in the administrative aspect of running a law  firm, including advertising for and training new employees. And then there's  the new employee learning curve.<br />
				  </p>
				<p>I have over eighteen years of experience in all aspects of  Estate and Guardianship document preparation including, petitions, orders  affidavits and reports. I have prepared and reviewed fiduciary accountings both  judicial and informal, prepared initial, annual and final reports of guardians  and prepared asset inventories. In estate matters, I have conducted research  and prepared due diligence reports for kinship trials.<br />
				  </p>
				<h3>What I Do<br />

                  <li>Meeting with attorneys/clients to gather information needed  for document preparation and financial reviews.</li>

                  <li>Establishing working relationships with court clerks in all  the counties.</li>

                  <li>Notarizing</li>
                  <li>Reviewing assets, analyzing financial portfolios, and  calculating income and disbursements for preparation of accountings and asset  inventories.</li>
