				<p>A freelance or independent contract paralegal is one who is self-employed and available to take on work for attorneys and others within the legal profession. As a freelance paralegal, I may assist you on cases for the short term, long term, per diem or per case projects with no commitments beyond any commissioned assignment. <br />
			    </p>
				<p>Accounting &amp; Fiduciary Services, which was formed in 2008, presently has a staff of 3 professionals, each specializing in a specific area - legal document preparation, financial analysis, and detailed records management. <br />
			    </p>
				<p>If your staff is too busy or you are a sole practitioner, simply stated, it is cost effective to hire an independent paralegal to work on specific projects or cases that will not require your firm's commitment to a full time salaried employee. Your firm will be free from the usual expenses required for a salaried employee. There are no overhead expenses, no health benefits, no vacation time, no sick time or employment taxes. You are billed only for the work completed, per a prearranged agreement.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>The sole practitioner or small law firm will certainly benefit from my more than eighteen years of experience in the areas of Guardianship proceedings both Article 81 and SCPA Article 17 and 17A, Estate Administration, including probate, administration and small estate proceedings, and all accountings associated with these proceedings. I have also worked in the areas of real estate, formation of corporations, adoptions, name changes and Social Security Disability proceedings. I am familiar with the Surrogate's Courts and Supreme Courts in the five boroughs and Westchester County, Nassau County and Suffolk County.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>Since Accounting and Fiduciary Services was formed, our company has specialized in working with Court Examiners to review annual accountings submitted by guardians and trustees. We also prepare the reports of examiners and all the supporting documents required by the various guardianship departments in the New York area.<br />
			    </p>
				<p>We have worked with more than 20 attorneys to assist in over 450 cases, most of which are on an annual basis for the past 5 years!<br />
