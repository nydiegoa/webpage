<h2>Peanut Butter and Jelly homepage</h2>
Here are 3 ways we created web pages:<br>
<ol>
  <li><a href="How%20to%20make%20a%20peanut%20butter%20and%20jelly%20sandwich.htm">This page</a> was created by saving a WORD file as an HTML doc</li>
  <li>I created <a href="PBJ2.html">this page</a> by copying and pasting text from a WORD doc to an HTML page</li>
  <li><a href="PBJ3.html">This page</a> was created by copying and pasting "unformatted" text into an HTML page<br>
  </li>
</ol>
